# Ready for Devnet Deployment

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** All scripts created, ready to deploy

---

## What's Ready

### Programs (Compiled and Tested)

- Market program (order matching, CritBit, escrow)
- OrderStore program (stubbed)
- OrderProcessor program (stubbed for ZK)

**Tests:** 11 unit tests passing

### UI (Enhanced and Simplified)

- Order type selector (Limit, FOK)
- Cancel buttons on each order
- CritBit tree visualization
- Transaction logging

**Multi-order matching:** Currently 1:N (can optimize to 1:1 later based on ZK needs)

### Deployment Scripts (Created)

**Windows:**
- `scripts/deploy-devnet.ps1` - Deploy programs
- `scripts/create-test-token.ps1` - Create test token

**Linux/WSL:**
- `scripts/deploy-devnet.sh` - Deploy programs
- `scripts/create-test-token.sh` - Create test token

**Cross-platform:**
- `scripts/init-devnet.ts` - Initialize market

**Documentation:**
- `DEVNET_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step guide
- `scripts/DEPLOYMENT_README.md` - Scripts overview

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Programs (5-10 minutes)

```powershell
cd anomi-zk-prototype
.\scripts\deploy-devnet.ps1
```

**Output:** Program IDs saved to `scripts/devnet-config.json`

### Step 2: Create Test Token (2-3 minutes)

```powershell
.\scripts\create-test-token.ps1
```

**Output:** Token mint saved to `scripts/test-token-mint.txt`

### Step 3: Initialize Market (2-3 minutes)

```bash
# Get token mint
$TOKEN_MINT = Get-Content scripts/test-token-mint.txt

# Initialize
ts-node scripts/init-devnet.ts $TOKEN_MINT
```

**Output:** UI config saved to `demo-ui/config.json`

**Total Time:** 10-15 minutes

## What Happens on Devnet

### After Deployment

**Programs Deployed:**
- Market program at <PROGRAM_ID>
- Viewable on Solana Explorer

**PDAs Created:**
- Market PDA - stores global market state
- OrderBook PDA - stores CritBit trees and orders
- Escrow Vault PDA - holds escrowed tokens
- Escrow Authority PDA - signing authority

**Test Token:**
- SPL token created
- 100,000 tokens minted to deployer
- Ready for trading

---

## After Deployment: Phase 3

**Next:** Add Phantom wallet to UI

**Will enable:**
- Connect Phantom wallet
- Place orders on devnet (real blockchain)
- Match orders between wallets
- Cancel orders (return real tokens)
- View PDAs on Solana Explorer

**Estimated time:** 4-6 hours for full Phantom integration

---

## Verification Checklist

After running deployment scripts:

**Files Created:**
- [ ] `scripts/devnet-config.json` (program IDs)
- [ ] `scripts/test-token-mint.txt` (token mint)
- [ ] `demo-ui/config.json` (UI configuration)

**On Devnet:**
- [ ] Market program deployed
- [ ] Market PDA initialized
- [ ] OrderBook PDA initialized
- [ ] Escrow Vault created
- [ ] Test token exists

**Explorer Verification:**
- [ ] Can view market program
- [ ] Can view PDAs
- [ ] Token mint visible
- [ ] Accounts show correct data

## Current Matching Logic

**On-Chain:** Multi-order matching (1:N)
- Bid can match multiple asks
- Returns vector of fills
- Works as-is for MVP

**Can modify later if needed for ZK:**
- Change `while` loop to single match in `order_book.rs`
- Enforce 1:1 on-chain
- Redeploy updated program

**For now:** Deploy current code, prove MVP works, optimize later

## Action Items

**Ready to deploy?**

```powershell
# Run from anomi-zk-prototype directory
.\scripts\deploy-devnet.ps1
```

This will:
1. Deploy programs to devnet
2. Save program IDs
3. Show next steps

**After deployment:**
- Confirm program IDs saved
- Run create-test-token script
- Run init-devnet script
- Verify on Solana Explorer

---

**Status:** Scripts ready, waiting for deployment execution

**Next:** Run deployment scripts and proceed to Phantom integration
