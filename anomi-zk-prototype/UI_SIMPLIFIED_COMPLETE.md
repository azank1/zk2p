# UI Simplified - Complete

**Implementation Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** Ready for Devnet Deployment

---

## Simplified Design

**Order Types:** 2 (Limit, FOK)  
**Matching:** 1:1 buyer:seller ratio  
**Features:** Place, Match, Cancel

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Order Type Selector

**Options:**
- Limit Order (default)
- FOK (Fill-or-Kill)

**Location:** Order entry form dropdown

### 2. Individual Cancel Buttons

**Feature:** Red "Cancel" button on each order

**Behavior:**
- Click to remove order
- Updates CritBit tree
- Updates UI automatically

### 3. 1:1 Matching Logic

**Limit Order:**
```
Match against FIRST compatible ask only
If bid > ask amount: Partial fill, rest becomes resting bid
If bid < ask amount: Full fill, ask remains with reduced amount
```

**FOK Order:**
```
Must match EXACTLY with first ask
If ask amount ≠ bid amount: REJECT
If ask amount = bid amount: FILL (perfect 1:1 match)
```

**Key Change:** No multi-order matching (was matching multiple asks)

---

## How It Works

### Example 1: Limit Order (Partial)

```
Order Book: Ask - Alice 100 @ $50

Buyer places Limit: 60 @ $55
Result:
- Match: 60 tokens from Alice @ $50
- Alice's remaining: 40 @ $50 (stays in book)
- Buyer filled: 60/60
```

### Example 2: Limit Order (Unfilled)

```
Order Book: Ask - Alice 30 @ $50

Buyer places Limit: 100 @ $55
Result:
- Match: 30 tokens from Alice @ $50
- Alice's order: Fully filled (removed)
- Buyer's remaining: 70 @ $55 (added as resting bid)
```

### Example 3: FOK Order (Reject)

```
Order Book: Ask - Alice 80 @ $50

Buyer places FOK: 100 @ $55
Result:
- REJECTED (need exactly 100, only 80 available)
- No match executed
- Order book unchanged
```

### Example 4: FOK Order (Success)

```
Order Book: Ask - Alice 100 @ $50

Buyer places FOK: 100 @ $55
Result:
- FILLED exactly (perfect match)
- Alice: Fully filled (removed)
- Buyer: 100/100 tokens
```

## ZK Proof Simplification

### Limit Order Settlement

```
Solvency Proof: Buyer has $5,500
    ↓
Match: 30 tokens @ $50 from Alice
    ↓
Fiat Transfer: $1,500 to Alice
    ↓
Payment Proof: Buyer proves payment
    ↓
Token Release: 30 tokens to Buyer

Total: 2 proofs, 1 transfer
```

### FOK Settlement (Even Simpler)

```
Solvency Proof: Buyer has $5,000
    ↓
Match: 100 tokens @ $50 from Alice (EXACT)
    ↓
Fiat Transfer: $5,000 to Alice
    ↓
Payment Proof: Buyer proves payment
    ↓
Token Release: 100 tokens to Buyer

Total: 2 proofs, 1 transfer, perfect amount
```

## Files Modified

**demo-ui/index.html:**
- Added cancel button CSS
- Added cancel buttons to each order
- Simplified order type dropdown (Limit, FOK only)
- Implemented `cancelOrder()` function
- Modified `executeLimitBid()` for 1:1 matching
- Modified `executeFOKBid()` for exact match
- Removed unused functions (Market, PostOnly, IOC)
- Removed test scenario buttons

**Lines Changed:** ~100 lines modified/removed

---

## Testing the UI

### Start Server

```bash
cd anomi-zk-prototype/demo-ui
.\start-server.bat
```

Open: http://127.0.0.1:8080

### Test Limit Order (1:1)

1. Place ask: Alice, 100 tokens, $50
2. Place ask: Bob, 50 tokens, $48  
3. Place bid: Buyer1, 150 tokens, $55 (Limit)

**Expected:**
- Matches Bob's 50 first (lower price)
- Buyer1 gets 50/150 tokens
- Buyer1's remaining 100 becomes resting bid @ $55

### Test FOK (Exact Match)

1. Place ask: Charlie, 75 tokens, $52
2. Place bid: Buyer2, 75 tokens, $55 (FOK)

**Expected:**
- Exact match (75 = 75)
- Charlie fully filled
- Buyer2 gets all 75 tokens

### Test FOK (Reject)

1. Place ask: Diana, 80 tokens, $50
2. Place bid: Buyer3, 100 tokens, $55 (FOK)

**Expected:**
- REJECTED (need 100, only 80 available)
- Transaction log shows error
- Order book unchanged

### Test Cancel

1. Place ask: Eve, 200 tokens, $60
2. Click "Cancel" button on Eve's order

**Expected:**
- Order removed from book
- CritBit tree updated
- UI refreshes

## Next: Phase 2 - Devnet Deployment

**Ready to deploy:**
- Programs compile
- Tests pass
- UI features complete
- 1:1 matching validated

**Next steps:**
1. Deploy to Solana devnet
2. Create test token
3. Initialize market
4. Test with scripts

---

**Status:** UI simplified and ready for blockchain integration
