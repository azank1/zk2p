- No price limit
- Fills whatever is available
- No resting order

**Post-Only Order:**
- REJECTS if would match immediately
- Only adds to book if no match
- Ensures maker status (for fee rebates)

**IOC (Immediate-or-Cancel):**
- Fills what's available

**FOK (Fill-or-Kill):**
- Must fill entire amount
- If not enough liquidity, REJECTS entirely

### 4. Test Scenarios

**One-Click Testing Buttons:**

**Scenario 1: Basic Limit Orders**
- Places 3 asks at different prices
- Places limit bid
- Shows partial matching with resting order

**Scenario 2: Market Order Sweep**
- Creates ask ladder (45, 48, 50)
- Market bid sweeps through all prices
- Demonstrates price-agnostic execution

**Scenario 3: Post-Only Test**
- Places ask at 50
- Tries post-only bid at 51 (REJECTED - would match)
- Tries post-only bid at 48 (ACCEPTED - maker only)

**Scenario 4: IOC Partial Fill**
- Limited asks (50 total)
- IOC bid for 100
- Fills 50, cancels 50

**Scenario 5: FOK All-or-Nothing**
- Places 80 tokens available
- FOK for 100 (REJECTED - not enough)
- FOK for 70 (FILLED - enough available)

## Next Steps

Once these features are validated in simulation:

1. Deploy programs to Solana devnet
2. Add Phantom wallet integration
3. Replace simulation with blockchain calls
4. Test with real wallets and tokens

**Current Status:** Simulation features complete, ready for devnet integration.
